##GitHub Repositories

###Description

Application made with React, in which a request is made to the GitHb Api using fetch, returning the list of repositories, in this particular case are the repositories of my profile. The list of repositories can be filtered by name, case insensitive.

###Run the project

You can run **npm start** to bring up the project at http://localhost:300 and view it in the browser.

You can also view it at:

[Netlify](https://github-repositories-with-filter.netlify.app/)

###Future improvements

- Add an input and a button to be able to search by user and that the Api returns the repositories of the specified user.
- User data (photo, number of repositories, followers...) can also be displayed dynamically.
- Show the list of repos only with the name of each one and that they are a link, so that when clicking on it, a small card with the details of the repository (description, languages used, update date...) is shown
